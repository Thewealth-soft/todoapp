This is the best way to write a code in vscode, can i atleast add the function of date to this todoApp this best way to do this is to do it yourself, how can i do this is it to clone it to the project. 


do i need to work on the interface before the coding, i can`t do this alone, does this mean i can write 2 line of code in a project
